# License Enforcement Records

This directory contains public, transparent records of AveryOS license enforcement events.

## Purpose

The AveryOS License Enforcement System provides:
- **Transparent tracking** of capsule usage and licensing
- **SHA-verified evidence** bundles for content creators
- **Voluntary compliance** options via Stripe licensing
- **Public accountability** through timestamped, immutable records

## Structure

- `evidence/` - SHA-verified evidence bundles (JSON manifests)
- `notices/` - Public license compliance notices
- `logs/` - Timestamped enforcement event logs

## Principles

✅ **Public Transparency**: All records are publicly viewable
✅ **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA-512 anchoring for all events
✅ **Voluntary Compliance**: Focus on offering licensing options
✅ **No Legal Threats**: No automated lawsuits or takedown notices
✅ **Creator Rights**: Helps creators track and protect their work

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: System detects potential unlicensed usage
2. **Evidence**: Creates SHA-verified evidence bundle
3. **Notice**: Publishes transparent compliance notice
4. **Offer**: Provides Stripe link for voluntary licensing
5. **Log**: Records event in public, timestamped log

All enforcement is transparent, optional, and focused on helping creators offer licenses to users of their content.
