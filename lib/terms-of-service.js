**Effective Date:** 2025-08-21  
**Entity:** AveryOS, LLC (Utah, USA) ("AveryOS", "we", "our", "us")  
**Contact:** legal@averyworld.com

## 1) Overview

These Terms govern access to and use of AveryOS.com, related sites, apps, APIs, documentation, and services (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms.

> **AveryAnchored™**: Certain site sections and downloadable artifacts are **SHA-anchored** to the **AveryOS Encrypted Deterministic Kernel** and **VaultChain**. Where indicated, you can verify integrity via our public verification endpoint and/or signed hash files linked in the footer.

## 2) Eligibility & Accounts

You must be capable of forming a binding contract and comply with these Terms and applicable laws. You are responsible for your account credentials, security, and all activity on your account.

## 3) Acceptable Use

You will not:
- violate laws or third-party rights (IP, privacy, export, sanctions, platform terms);
- probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system without written permission;
- interfere with or disrupt the Services;
- use the Services to develop, train, or refine models or systems intended to replicate AveryOS, its kernel, VaultChain, or derivative governance mechanisms;
- remove, obscure, or alter notices of authorship, SHA anchors, or license legends.

## 4) Intellectual Property; License Notices

All site content, code, designs, models, documentation, and governance artifacts are protected by intellectual property laws and are owned or licensed by AveryOS. Except where expressly permitted in writing, **no license** is granted to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works.  
**License block:** © 1992–2025 Jason Lee Avery / AveryOS. All Rights Reserved. Licensed under **AveryOS Sovereign Integrity License v1.0** (see footer). Public hash files are authenticity proofs, **not** licenses to use IP.

## 5) Third-Party Services

The Services may integrate third-party services (e.g., CDN, analytics, payment, auth). Your use of third-party services may be subject to their terms. We do not control or assume responsibility for third-party services.

## 6) Beta, Experimental, and Verification Features

We may label features as "beta," "experimental," or "AveryAnchored verify." Such features are provided **as-is** and may change or be discontinued.

## 7) Availability; Changes

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or any part thereof. We will endeavor to provide reasonable notice where practicable.

## 8) Feedback

If you provide feedback, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license to use it without restriction or compensation.

## 9) Confidentiality

Non-public information you receive from us (including keys, credentials, artifacts not designated as public) must be kept confidential and used only as authorized.

## 10) Privacy

Our **Privacy Policy** explains how we collect, use, and share information and is incorporated by reference. Please review it carefully.

## 11) Security; Verification

We implement administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards proportional to risk.  
**AveryAnchored Verification.** Where indicated, resources carry a **SHA-512** digest and may be verifiable via **/.well-known/averyos.json** and **/verify** (Merkle-proof capable). Verification proofs attest **integrity and lineage**, not license or authorship transfer.

## 12) Geo-Legal Notices & Market Access

- **People's Republic of China (PRC)**: AveryOS does **not** operate servers in the PRC and does not localize personal data in the PRC. The Services are **not targeted to users located in the PRC** and may be restricted.  
- **Russian Federation & Türkiye**: Due to data localization and other regulatory constraints, AveryOS does **not** operate servers in these jurisdictions, does **not** localize personal data there, and may restrict access.  
- **Sanctions/Export**: You may not use the Services if you are subject to sanctions/embargoes or in prohibited locations under U.S. law.  
These disclosures are provided to be clear about AveryOS's operational footprint and compliance posture.

## 13) Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AVERYOS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

## 14) Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AVERYOS AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

## 17) Governing Law; Venue; Arbitration

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Utah** and the **United States**, without regard to conflicts principles. Except for claims seeking injunctive relief, **binding arbitration** under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association will resolve disputes, with venue in **Utah County, Utah**. YOU WAIVE CLASS ACTIONS AND JURY TRIALS TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 18) International Use

You are responsible for compliance with local laws. Where local law conflicts with these Terms, you must refrain from using restricted portions of the Services.
