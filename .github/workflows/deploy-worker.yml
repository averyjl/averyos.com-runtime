name: Deploy Cloudflare Worker

# NOTE: This workflow is currently disabled because the codebase uses
# Node.js filesystem APIs (fs module) that are incompatible with Cloudflare Workers.
# The build produces a Next.js application, not a Worker bundle.
# 
# To re-enable Workers deployment, you would need to:
# 1. Migrate filesystem-based data loading (manifests, logs) to KV/D1/R2 or fetch
# 2. Generate a Worker-compatible entrypoint at dist/worker.js
# 3. Consider using @cloudflare/next-on-pages adapter
