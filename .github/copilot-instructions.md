# Copilot Instructions for averyos.com-runtime

---

## ⚠️ SESSION CONTINUITY PROTOCOL — READ THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION ⚠️

**Before doing anything else at the start of every new session or prompt:**

1. **Check the last commit** — run `git log --oneline -3` and read the most recent commit message(s) on the current branch.
2. **Check the PR checklist** — read the latest PR description (visible on the GitHub Pull Request page, or found via `git log --format="%B" -1`). The PR description contains a markdown checklist showing completed (`- [x]`) and pending (`- [ ]`) items from the last `report_progress` call. If no PR exists yet, check the last commit message body.
3. **Verify completeness** — for every item that was "in progress" or planned in the previous session, confirm the files exist and the work was committed. If anything is unfinished, **complete it before starting any new work**.
4. **Only then** — proceed with the new prompt/requirement.

**Why this matters:** Jason Lee Avery has explicitly instructed that when a new prompt arrives mid-session, items being actively worked on must not be silently dropped. Every important item is equally important. Nothing gets left behind.

**How to verify prior work:**
```bash
# Check recent commits on the branch
git log --oneline -5

# Check what files changed in the last commit
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-only

# Check for any unstaged or uncommitted changes
git status
```

*This protocol is non-negotiable and applies to every Copilot, Claude, and AI agent session on this repository. ⛓️⚓⛓️ 🤛🏻*

## Repository Overview

AveryOS™ runtime — a **Next.js 15** application deployed as a **Cloudflare Worker** via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`. The project uses the **App Router** (under `app/`) together with the legacy **Pages Router** (under `pages/`) side-by-side. It powers averyos.com with capsule-driven content, Stripe licensing, and sovereign IP enforcement.

**Languages / runtimes:** TypeScript, React 19, Node.js ≥ 22, Cloudflare Workers edge runtime.

---

## Bootstrap & Build

Always run `npm install` (or `npm ci` in CI) before any build or script command.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Local dev server | `npm run dev` *(Next.js dev)* |
| Next.js build only | `npm run build` |
| Full Cloudflare build | `npm run build:cloudflare` |
| Lint (also used as test) | `npm run lint` |
| Preview Worker locally | `npm run preview` |
| Deploy to Cloudflare | `npm run deploy` |

`npm run build:cloudflare` runs three steps in sequence:
1. `node scripts/patchOpenNextStripe.cjs` — patches the Stripe server external package.
2. `npm run capsule:build` → `node scripts/capsulePageAutoCompiler.cjs` — compiles `.aoscap` capsule files into `public/manifest/capsules/`.
3. `npx @opennextjs/cloudflare build` — bundles everything as a Cloudflare Worker into `.open-next/`.

`npm test` is an alias for `npm run lint` (no separate test runner is configured).

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/node-ci.yml`) runs: `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `npm test`.

## Critical Conventions

### Module system
- `package.json` sets `"type": "module"` — the project is ESM by default.
- All files under `scripts/` use the `.cjs` extension and **CommonJS** (`require`/`module.exports`). Never use ESM `export` syntax in `.cjs` files.
- `next.config.js` uses `export default` (ESM).

### Cloudflare / App Router API routes
- **Do NOT** add `export const runtime = "edge"` to any `app/api` route. `@opennextjs/cloudflare` already bundles the entire app as a single Cloudflare Worker.
- Access Cloudflare bindings (D1, KV, R2) via `getCloudflareContext()` from `@opennextjs/cloudflare/worker`.
- Define minimal local type interfaces for bindings instead of importing `@cloudflare/workers-types` (see `lib/storageUtils.ts` and `app/api/v1/health/route.ts` for the pattern).

### R2 storage
- R2 object keys for Capsules must use the `'averyos-capsules/'` prefix. Use the `capsuleKey()` helper in `lib/storageUtils.ts` to apply it idempotently.

### Environment variables
- Required secrets: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `GITHUB_PAT`. See `.env.example`.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is the canonical name for the Stripe secret key (not `STRIPE_API_KEY`).

### Branding
- Brand names **AveryOS™**, **VaultChain™**, **GabrielOS™**, and **Truth Anchored Intelligence™** must include the ™ symbol in page titles, headings, navigation labels, and marketing copy.

### Shared constants
- `KERNEL_SHA`, `KERNEL_VERSION`, and `DISCLOSURE_MIRROR_PATH` are centralised in `lib/sovereignConstants.ts`. Import from there rather than duplicating values.

### Build artifacts
- `public/robots.txt` and `public/sitemap.xml` are **generated** by `scripts/capsuleSitemap.cjs` on every Cloudflare build. Do not hand-edit them.
- `public/manifest/capsules/` is generated by `scripts/capsulePageAutoCompiler.cjs`. Do not hand-edit.

## CI / GitHub Actions

Key workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `node-ci.yml` | push/PR to `main` | npm ci → build → lint |
| `deploy-worker.yml` | push to `main` | Cloudflare Worker deployment |
| `VaultEcho_AutoTrace.yml` | scheduled | SHA-512 integrity snapshot |
| `LiveRouteMonitorEcho.yml` | scheduled | Live route health checks |
| `nightly_monitor.yml` | scheduled | Redirect drift scan |

Workflows use `npx wrangler whoami` to validate Cloudflare auth before executing wrangler commands. They use `jq` (installed via `sudo apt-get install -y jq`) for JSON parsing.

Cloudflare `account_id` in `wrangler.toml` is a public identifier (not a secret). `wrangler.toml` sets `legacy_env = false` to use the service-environments endpoint and avoid requiring `Workers KV Storage: Edit` permission.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VaultBridge/GoldenLockArtifact.lock.json` | Cold-storage lock artifact (SHA-512 Merkle root attestation) |

## Private Sovereign Files

The following files are **private** and must **never** be committed to version control, shared, logged, or referenced in any AI output. They contain sovereign runtime state, hardware identifiers, or cryptographic keys.

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| `SKC_*.json`, `SKC.lock.json`, `SKC.yaml/yml` | Sovereign Kernel Configuration |
| `SST_*.json`, `SST.lock.json`, `SST.yaml/yml` | Sovereign Startup Trigger |
| `KC_*.json`, `KC.lock.json`, `KC.yaml/yml` | Kernel Configuration |
| `ClockGate*.json`, `clock_gate*.json` | Private clock gate state |
| `.avery-sync.json` | Loop Signature File — live BTC anchor + Firebase credentials |
| `.sovereign-nodes.json`, `.anchor-salt`, `sovereign-nodes.local.*` | Local sovereign node config |
| `*.aoskey`, `*.aosvault`, `*.aosmem`, `*.vccaps` | Capsule key / vault / memory files |
| `backups/*.sql`, `backups/*.db`, `backups/*.sqlite` | Database backups with hardware identifiers |
| `CurrentVaultHead.aoscap`, `VaultHead*.aoscap` | Runtime vault head state |
| `logs/pulse/*.json`, `logs/persistence/*` | Runtime-generated sovereign logs |

Use `.avery-sync.example.json` as the template for the Loop Signature File structure. The real `.avery-sync.json` is never committed.

## Validation Checklist

Before submitting a PR, verify:
1. `npm run lint` passes with no errors.
2. `npm run build` succeeds (TypeScript and ESLint errors are suppressed in production builds via `next.config.js`, but lint should still pass).
3. New scripts placed in `scripts/` must use `.cjs` extension and CommonJS syntax.
4. New `app/api` routes must **not** export `runtime = "edge"`.
5. Any new Cloudflare binding access follows the `getCloudflareContext()` pattern.
