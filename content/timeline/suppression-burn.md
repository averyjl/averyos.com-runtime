## What is Suppression Burn?

Suppression Burn is a security mechanism that automatically detects and neutralizes attempts to suppress or censor capsule content.

## Timeline Events

### Phase 1: Detection
- Monitoring systems identify suppression attempts
- Pattern analysis reveals censorship vectors
- Threat classification and scoring

### Phase 2: Documentation
- Events are logged with cryptographic timestamps
- Evidence bundles are generated
- Witnesses are notified

### Phase 3: Response
- Alternative distribution channels activated
- Content mirrors are established
- Community alerts are broadcast

### Phase 4: Recovery
- Normal operations are restored
- Post-incident analysis conducted
- Strengthened defenses implemented

## Historical Suppression Events

*Timeline of detected and mitigated suppression attempts will be displayed here*

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Systems watch for access patterns indicating suppression
2. **Anomaly Detection**: AI models identify unusual blocking or throttling
3. **Automatic Escalation**: Detected threats trigger response protocols
4. **Community Notification**: Stakeholders are alerted immediately
5. **Burn Protocol**: Suppression attempts are rendered ineffective

## Protection Mechanisms

- **Distributed Hosting**: Content replicated across multiple nodes
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Ensures content authenticity
- **Decentralized Access**: No single point of failure
- **Transparent Logging**: All events publicly recorded
