# Build and deploy AveryOS runtime to Cloudflare Workers (production env).
# Requires Bun + Wrangler auth to already be configured.

# NOTE: This script is currently not functional because:
# 1. The codebase uses Node.js filesystem APIs (fs module) incompatible with Workers
# 2. No Worker bundle (dist/worker.js) is generated by the build process
# 3. The build produces a Next.js application, not a Worker entrypoint
#
# See wrangler.toml for more details on Workers compatibility requirements.

# Ensure the expected Worker bundle exists before deploying.
