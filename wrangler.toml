# NOTE: This Wrangler configuration is currently not functional.
# The codebase is a Next.js application that uses Node.js filesystem APIs
# (fs module) which are not available in Cloudflare Workers runtime.
#
# To deploy to Cloudflare Workers, you would need to:
# 1. Migrate filesystem-based data loading to fetch from public URLs or KV/D1/R2
# 2. Create a Worker-compatible entrypoint at dist/worker.js
# 3. Potentially use @cloudflare/next-on-pages or similar adapter
#
# For now, deploy this as a standard Next.js app on platforms like Vercel,
# Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages (with Next.js support).
